==================================================================

The tidy data set annexed to this document is based on the raw data from the HAR project. 


First file "HAR_data_mean_std_XYZ.txt" includes the following data:
======================================

- Subject number (from 1 to 30)
- Activity label (belong to following activities: WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING & LAYING)
- Mean for X,Y and Z.
- Standard Deviation for X,Y and Z.

Second file "Summary_HAR_subject.txt" includes the following data:
=====================================
-Subject (from 1 to 30)
-Mean for MeanX,MeanY and MeanZ
-Mean for StdX,StdY,StdZ

Third file "Summary_HAR_activity.txt" includes the following data:
=====================================
-Activity (WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING & LAYING)
-Mean for MeanX,MeanY and MeanZ
-Mean for StdX,StdY,StdZ

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'
-  "Codebook_data_mean_std_XYZ.txt" 
- "HAR_data_mean_std_XYZ.txt" 
- "Summary_HAR_subject.txt" 
- "Summary_HAR_activity.txt"
-  R script "run_analysis.R"

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
