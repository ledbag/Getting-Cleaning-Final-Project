Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate an ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. The requirement is to submit: 1. a tidy data set as described below 1. a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis 1. a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 1. a README.md in the repo with the scripts.

Background

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

Details of the Data Set

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix ‘t’ to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. and the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ).

The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).

A Fast Fourier Transformation was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag.

Basis of Data Set information

Experiments were carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

There are a R script called run_analysis.R, with the following actions:

##Load libraries used in the script

library(dplyr)

##Loading of raw data in R variables

## Merging of raw data in only one file (from Test & Training, including Activity
##and Subject test. The variable called total1 have a subsetting of data
##including only the mean() and std() in X,Y and Z coordinates.

## Correction and assignation of descriptive names to each variable 
##in tidy data set


## Categories on Activity 
## Change of numeric levels for Activity variable to 
##names included in activity_label file.
##Generation of tidy data set. called total.set

total.set<-select(total.set,-Activity)
total.set<-cbind(Act8,total.set)

##Next steps set the names of tidy data

## Next step is to group by Activity and also by Subject. 
## With each group is generated a summary including the
